# Binary Transparency Log for https://guardianproject.info/fdroid

This is a log of the signed app index metadata.  This is stored in a
git repo, which serves as an imperfect append-only storage mechanism.
People can then check that any file that they received from that
F-Droid repository was a publicly released file.
